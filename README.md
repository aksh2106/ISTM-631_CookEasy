## About taking a pull
Please make sure to create a branch from the 'Master' branch, clone that branch to your local machine and do your development on that branch. **Do not do anything on Master branch directly to avoid any conflicts.

## About pushing the code
After you complete your development on your created branch, stage and commit the code, and push it to origin. Then, on Github, create a pull request from your created branch to Master. Look for any conflicts,if not, you are good. Merge it. Otherwise take a pull again, update your branch you're working on (on your local machine) and push again. 

## Word of caution 
As a good practice, before you do any development on your created branch which has gone old by a day or two, please take a pull again so that you have the most updated version of code. Its possible in the meantime someone else would have pushed their code and the Master would have changed, and you would end up with stale code on your local causing conflicts while merging with Master later.

Lastly, Give meaningful names to the branches you create and the commit message you provide while pushing the code.
